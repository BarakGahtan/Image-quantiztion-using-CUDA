# Image-quantiztion-using-CUDA
n this assignment we will implement image quantization for grayscale images. This method reduces the number of colors used in an image.  The algorithm we will implement works by first creating a histogram of the gray levels in the image, then using the histogram to create a map which maps each value of these levels to a new value, and finally, using this map to create the new image.  We will implement quantization on MxN grayscale images, each represented as a unsigned char array of length M*N, with values in the range [0, 255], where 0 means black, and 255 means white
